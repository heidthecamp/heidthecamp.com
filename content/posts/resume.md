### Summary
I am an Operation Support Engineer at Vistaprint where I work with Product Specialists to ensure that product launches go smoothly and fix prod incidences when they don't. As an OSE, I need to be familiar with a wide selection of tools, processes, and troubleshooting techniques. I am always eager to add to the list of tools and skills I have at my disposal to solve challenges. I spend much of what little free time I have working on projects ranging from building my personal website to physical/digital projects with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos; such as an aquaponic garden system that controls the lights and pumps to help encourage a healthy system. I am looking for an environment where I can continue to grow as a developer and where I can solve interesting challenges everyday with other intelligent and driven people.
